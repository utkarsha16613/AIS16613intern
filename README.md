# Case Study on Titanic Data - 

1) data  reading and importing necessary libraries 
data preprocessing : 
2) finding missing values ,fill or drop
3) if needed droping variable 
4) label encoding for categorical variable 

Visualisation:
EDA: bar plot , scatter plot ,joint bar plot,Pie chart, etc

Model building:
5)choosing dependent and independent variables
6) split data into train test (80:20)
Importing algorithms - 1) Naive Bayes
                       2) KNN 
                       3) Decision Tree
Fitting these models and finding accuracy, precision score, recall and f1 score of all the models
And comparing algorithms on the basis of this criterion.

# Power BI Dashboard - 

 For Customer Churn Data created a dashboard to analyze the data effectively. 

# Internship Final Project - 

Downloading Customer Churn Data from Kaggle website.(Secondary Data)
Reading data and importing necessary libraries.
Data Preprocessing :  
                    Finding missing values, filling and droping unnecessary variables.
                    
Visualization : 
                Plotting of Pie charts, bar charts, box plots 

Label Encoding for categorical data.

Model Building - 10 algorithms
1) Logistic Model
2) Naive Bayes
3) KNN
4) Decision Tree
5) Random Forest
6) Gradient Boosting Classifier
7) Bagging Meta Estimator
8) Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
9) XGBooster
10) Stacking Classifier

Comparision on accuracy, precision and recall for these graphs.

Model fitting using GridSearchCV for finding best parameters to increase accuracies, precision score and recall.
Comparision the accuracies, precision and recall of this models by plots.

Model fitting on the basis of feature selection. i.e.with important variables
comparision plots for this models also.

Finally comparing all the base models, models using GridSearchCV and feature importance.

Conclusion - 
            Making conclusions on this study using plots, EDA and Data Analysis done by fitting different models
            Finding the best classifying model.
